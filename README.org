* How to develop
Only a recent version of Hugo is needed to build this page.
The [[https://github.com/mefabis/hugo-theme-nostyleplease][theme used]] is provided as a submodule, to get it you need to run the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
#+END_SRC
As a convenient way to get the dependencies, a Nix flake is provided. It needs the new CLI and Flakes enabled to be used:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ nix develop
#+END_SRC
